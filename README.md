1. **/ngs_growthRate_dataAnalysis** describes my computational workflow for analyzing high-throughput next-generation sequencing data I collected from experiments. 

2. **/pySCA_tutorial** provides guidance for biologists that wish to apply the Statistical Coupling Analysis (SCA) to analyze their protein of interest but are unfamilliar with using the command line. These notebooks help the user identify if the data for their protein is appropriate for analysis with SCA. In a second notebook, the user is guided through how to interpret the results of SCA that can help inform hyptohesis to experimentally test in the lab.
